# `pages` Folder

This folder contains all the pages that will be part of the application. Details on required numbers will be provided in the Phase 3 documentation.

These pages are meant to show you an example of some of the features of Streamlit and the way we will limit functionality access by role/persona. It is not meant to represent a complete application.

TODO: Describe the pages folder and include link to documentation. Don't forget about ordering of pages.

The pages are organized by first digit, where any page related to the president role leads with 0, any page related to the maintenance worker role leads with 1, any page related to the Student Roles leads with 2, and any page related to the Deans leads with 3.
