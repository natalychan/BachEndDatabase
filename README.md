Update the ReadME file to describe your project, any information the user needs to build/start the containers (such as adding the secrets passwords files), etc.  Include each team memberâ€™s name somewhere in the README.

## What is BachEndDatabase?

The Bach-End Database is a centralized data platform designed for Join U, streamlining access to detailed information and analytics for every role within the university. By consolidating data into a single, unified system, it eliminates the inefficiencies of current decentralized solutions, where information is stored in separate systems that make cross-departmental analysis slow, tedious, and incomplete.

Unlike existing tools, the BachEnd Database connects related datasets and provides both high-level overviews and granular insights, ensuring that important lower-level details aren't overlooked. This comprehensive approach enables faster, more informed decision-making across the institution.

The system supports a diverse range of users, including the university president, college deans, professors, students, and maintenance staff. All users can access role-specific dashboards and analytics from the same interface, reducing digital clutter and simplifying workflows. 

- The university president can compare academic performance and resource usage across colleges.
- Students can easily view grades, enrollment information, and course details.
- Maintenance staff can track work orders, monitor room usage, and prioritize tasks efficiently.

By integrating these perspectives into one platform, the Bach-End Database empowers the university to identify trends, address problems promptly, and improve overall institutional performance.
